# Custom Software Development Tailored Process

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive tailored process that has been added to the PM Standards Hub application for **Custom Software Development Projects**.

## Project Context

### Characteristics
- **Duration:** Less than 6 months
- **Team Size:** Fewer than 7 team members
- **Requirements:** Well-defined and documented
- **Approach:** Agile/iterative delivery preferred
- **Complexity:** Moderate technical complexity with known technologies
- **Budget:** Limited, requiring lean processes

### Tailoring Rationale
This lightweight process is optimized for **speed and flexibility** while maintaining essential governance. It combines agile practices with structured milestones, minimizes documentation overhead, and empowers the small team with clear decision-making authority.

## Process Structure

### Five Project Phases

#### 1. Initiation & Planning (1-2 weeks)
- Define project vision and success criteria
- Identify and analyze key stakeholders
- Assemble project team and define roles
- Refine and prioritize requirements
- Select development approach and tools
- Create release roadmap and sprint plan
- Identify initial risks and mitigation strategies
- Establish quality standards and testing approach

**Decision Gate:** Project Kickoff Approval

#### 2. Iterative Development (3-4 months, 6-8 sprints)
- Sprint planning and story refinement
- Daily standup meetings (15 minutes)
- Develop features and write code
- Continuous integration and automated testing
- Sprint reviews and demos
- Sprint retrospectives
- Risk monitoring and issue management
- Scope change and backlog management
- Progress and velocity tracking

**Decision Gate:** Mid-Project Review (after Sprint 3-4)

#### 3. Testing & Hardening (2-3 weeks)
- Comprehensive integration testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Security and performance testing
- Defect fixing and code stabilization
- Deployment and rollback procedures
- User documentation and training materials

**Decision Gate:** Go/No-Go Deployment Decision

#### 4. Deployment & Transition (1 week)
- Production deployment execution
- Post-deployment stability monitoring
- User training sessions
- Transition to operations and support
- Benefits realization metrics

**Decision Gate:** Operational Acceptance

#### 5. Closure & Lessons Learned (1 week)
- Final project retrospective
- Complete project documentation
- Obtain formal acceptance
- Release team resources
- Close contracts and finances
- Celebrate project success

**Decision Gate:** Project Closure Approval

## Key Roles

1. **Project Sponsor** (2-4 hours/week)
   - Approve project charter
   - Provide resources
   - Make key decisions
   - Review progress at gates

2. **Product Owner** (15-20 hours/week)
   - Define vision and requirements
   - Prioritize backlog
   - Accept completed work
   - Make scope decisions

3. **Project Manager / Scrum Master** (20-30 hours/week)
   - Plan and track work
   - Facilitate ceremonies
   - Remove blockers
   - Report status
   - Manage risks

4. **Development Team** (3-5 developers, full-time)
   - Implement features
   - Write tests
   - Code reviews
   - Estimate work
   - Self-organize

5. **QA/Test Lead** (20-30 hours/week)
   - Define test strategy
   - Execute tests
   - Track defects
   - Verify quality standards

## Key Artifacts

1. **Project Charter** - Project authorization and objectives
2. **Product Backlog** - Prioritized requirements
3. **Sprint Backlog** - Current sprint commitments
4. **Definition of Done** - Completion criteria
5. **Risk Register** - Identified risks and mitigations
6. **Burndown/Burnup Chart** - Progress visualization
7. **Working Software** - Potentially shippable increments
8. **Test Results and Quality Reports** - Quality documentation
9. **Retrospective Notes** - Lessons learned

## Tailoring Decisions

### 1. Lightweight Documentation
**Rationale:** Small team and short timeline require minimal overhead
**Tradeoff:** May need more knowledge transfer at handover, but speeds delivery

### 2. Short 2-Week Sprints
**Rationale:** Aggressive timeline needs frequent feedback cycles
**Tradeoff:** More ceremonies, but reduces risk of wrong features

### 3. Simplified Governance
**Rationale:** Small team with clear requirements doesn't need heavy governance
**Tradeoff:** Less formal controls, but enables faster decisions

### 4. Continuous Integration & Automated Testing
**Rationale:** Essential for maintaining quality with rapid pace
**Tradeoff:** Initial setup time, but quick payoff

### 5. Combined PM/Scrum Master Role
**Rationale:** Team size doesn't justify separate roles
**Tradeoff:** Potential role conflict, managed through clear expectations

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Clear and Stable Requirements** (Critical)
   - Thorough requirements review in initiation
   - Product Owner available for quick clarification

2. **Engaged and Available Product Owner** (Critical)
   - Secure 15-20 hour/week commitment upfront
   - Establish communication protocols

3. **Skilled Development Team** (High)
   - Select members with relevant experience
   - Provide training if needed early

4. **Effective Daily Communication** (High)
   - Non-negotiable daily standups
   - Use collaboration tools for async communication

5. **Rapid Decision-Making** (High)
   - Empower Product Owner for scope decisions
   - Clear escalation path to Sponsor

6. **Continuous Stakeholder Feedback** (Medium-High)
   - Mandatory sprint reviews with demo
   - Interim feedback encouraged
