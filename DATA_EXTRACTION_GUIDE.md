# Data Extraction Guide

This guide will help you extract and add more content from your PM standards PDFs to the application.

## üìã Quick Reference

The application uses `references.json` to store all data. You'll add content in three main sections:

1. **Repository Items**: Individual topics/sections from standards
2. **Comparisons**: Side-by-side topic comparisons
3. **Insights**: Similarities, differences, and unique elements

## üîç How to Extract Content from Your PDFs

### Step 1: Open Your PDFs
You have these files in your directory:
- `PM uniqueness .pdf` - Contains unique elements analysis
- `PM_standards_comparison.pdf` - Contains comparison data
- The actual standard PDFs (PMBOK, PRINCE2, ISO)

### Step 2: Extract Repository Items

For each important topic in the standards, create a repository entry:

```json
{
  "id": "pmbok-topic-name",
  "standard": "pmbok",
  "title": "Clear Topic Title",
  "content": "1-2 sentence description of what this section covers",
  "page": 123,
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
}
```

**Example Process:**
1. Open PMBOK 7 PDF
2. Find a major section (e.g., "Team Performance Domain" on page 93)
3. Read the introduction/summary
4. Create the JSON entry with:
   - Unique ID: `pmbok-team-1`
   - Title: "Team Performance Domain"
   - Content: Summary paragraph
   - Page number: 93
   - Keywords: ["team", "collaboration", "leadership", "performance"]

### Step 3: Extract Comparisons

For each topic you want to compare (e.g., Risk, Stakeholder, Quality):

```json
"topic-name": {
  "pmbok": {
    "title": "How PMBOK refers to this",
    "description": "PMBOK's approach to this topic",
    "page": 145,
    "keyPoints": [
      "Key point 1",
      "Key point 2",
      "Key point 3"
    ]
  },
  "prince2": {
    "title": "How PRINCE2 refers to this",
    "description": "PRINCE2's approach to this topic",
    "page": 123,
    "keyPoints": [
      "Key point 1",
      "Key point 2"
    ]
  },
  "iso": {
    "standard": "iso21502",
    "title": "How ISO refers to this",
    "description": "ISO's approach to this topic",
    "page": 78,
    "keyPoints": [
      "Key point 1",
      "Key point 2"
    ]
  },
  "analysis": {
    "similarities": [
      "What all three have in common",
      "Another similarity"
    ],
    "differences": [
      "How they differ",
      "Another difference"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "When to use which approach",
      "Best practices from multiple standards"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example Process:**
1. Choose a topic (e.g., "Procurement")
2. Find relevant sections in each standard:
   - PMBOK 7: Search for "Procurement" or "Acquisition"
   - PRINCE2: Look in relevant Theme or Process
   - ISO 21502: Find Procurement process
3. For each standard, note:
   - Title used for this topic
   - Main description/approach
   - Page number
   - 3-5 key points
4. Analyze:
   - What do all three say that's similar?
   - How do they differ?
   - What recommendations can you make?

### Step 4: Extract Insights

#### Similarities
Find common practices across all standards:

```json
{
  "topic": "Common Practice Name",
  "description": "Explanation of what all standards agree on",
  "references": [
    { "standard": "pmbok", "page": 73 },
    { "standard": "prince2", "page": 95 },
    { "standard": "iso21502", "page": 30 }
  ]
}
```

#### Differences
Find where standards diverge:

```json
{
  "topic": "Area of Difference",
  "standards": [
    { "standard": "pmbok", "approach": "PMBOK's approach", "page": 25 },
    { "standard": "prince2", "approach": "PRINCE2's approach", "page": 45 },
    { "standard": "iso21500", "approach": "ISO's approach", "page": 15 }
  ]
}
```

#### Unique Elements
Find what's unique to each standard:

```json
{
  "standard": "pmbok",
  "topic": "Unique Feature Name",
  "description": "What makes this unique to this standard",
  "page": 10
}
```
