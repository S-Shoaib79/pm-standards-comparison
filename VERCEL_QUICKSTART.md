## 🔧 If PDFs Are Too Large

### Quick Fix:

2. **Upload to Google Drive instead**
3. **Get shareable links** (Anyone with link can view)
4. **Update `app.js` on GitHub**:

Edit lines 1-12 in `app.js`:

```javascript
const PDF_FILES = {
    pmbok: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID",
    prince2: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID",
    iso21500: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID",
    iso21502: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID"
};
```
