## ✨ Yes, I can deploy this to Vercel for you!

Everything is ready. Follow these simple steps:

---

## 📦 What's Been Prepared

**Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ⭐ Very Easy

1. Create GitHub account (if needed): https://github.com/signup
2. Create new repository: https://github.com/new
3. Upload your files via web interface
4. Sign up for Vercel: https://vercel.com/signup
5. Import your GitHub repository
6. Click "Deploy"
7. ✨ Done! Your app is live!

**👉 Full instructions**: Open `DEPLOY_NOW.md`

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (If you have Node.js)
**Time**: 3-5 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Moderate

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
cd "D:\sem 5\PM"
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**👉 Full instructions**: Open `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## ⚠️ Important: PDF Files

Your PDF files are large (~18MB total). You have two options:

### Option A: Include PDFs in Deployment
- ✅ Works if total size < 100MB
- ✅ PDFs load directly from your site
- ⚠️ Slower initial deployment
- ⚠️ May hit GitHub size limits

### Option B: Host PDFs Separately (Recommended)
- ✅ Faster deployment
- ✅ No size limits
- ✅ Better performance
- 📤 Upload PDFs to Google Drive/Dropbox
- 🔗 Update links in `app.js`

**See Step 7 in `DEPLOY_NOW.md` for details**

After deployment, your app will be live at:
```
