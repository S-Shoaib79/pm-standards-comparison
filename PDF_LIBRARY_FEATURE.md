# PDF Library Feature Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive PDF Library feature has been added to the PM Standards Hub, allowing users to access, read, and bookmark pages from all four project management standards: PMBOK Guide 7th Edition, PRINCE2 7th Edition, ISO 21500:2021, and ISO 21502:2020.

## Features Implemented

### 1. PDF Library Tab
- **Location**: New tab in the main navigation bar
- **Display**: Grid layout with 4 book cards, one for each standard
- **Book Cards Include**:
  - Visual cover design with gradient colors
  - Full title and edition information
  - Brief description of each standard
  - Metadata (publisher, year, bookmark count)
  - "Open Book" button to launch the PDF viewer

### 2. Enhanced PDF Viewer
The PDF viewer has been completely redesigned with advanced controls:

#### Navigation Controls
- **Previous/Next Page Buttons**: Arrow buttons for quick page navigation
- **Page Number Input**: Direct page number entry with Enter key support
- **Page Counter**: Shows current page and total pages

#### Bookmark Functionality
- **Bookmark Button**: Star icon to save/remove bookmarks
  - Empty star = not bookmarked
  - Filled golden star = bookmarked
- **Visual Feedback**: Color changes to indicate bookmark status
- **Bookmark Sidebar**: Slide-out panel showing all bookmarks
  - Click list icon to toggle sidebar visibility
  - Each bookmark shows page number
  - Quick navigation to bookmarked pages
  - Delete individual bookmarks

#### Smart Page Persistence
- **Last Read Page**: Automatically saves the last page viewed
- **Resume Reading**: When reopening a book, it automatically opens to the last page you read
- **Per-Book Memory**: Each standard maintains its own last read page

### 3. Data Persistence
All bookmark and reading position data is stored in browser localStorage:
- `bookmarks_{standard}`: Array of bookmark objects
- `lastPage_{standard}`: Last page number viewed
- Persists across browser sessions
- No server-side storage required

### 4. Modern UI/UX Design

#### Color Scheme
- **PMBOK**: Blue gradient (#3b82f6 → #2563eb)
- **PRINCE2**: Green gradient (#10b981 → #059669)
- **ISO Standards**: Orange gradient (#f59e0b → #d97706)

#### Visual Improvements
- Clean, modern design with smooth transitions
- Card hover effects with elevation changes
- Gradient backgrounds and smooth shadows
- Professional typography with letter spacing
- Responsive button interactions
- Subtle animations throughout

#### Interface Elements
- No emoji clutter - clean professional icons using SVG
- Consistent rounded corners (10-16px border radius)
- Layered shadows for depth perception
- Color-coded standard badges
- Glassmorphism effects on controls

## User Guide

### Opening a Book
1. Click the "PDF Library" tab in navigation
2. Choose a standard from the 4 available books
3. Click "Open Book" button
4. The book opens at your last read page (or page 1 if first time)

### Bookmarking Pages
1. Navigate to the page you want to bookmark
2. Click the bookmark icon (star) in the PDF viewer controls
3. The star turns gold to indicate the page is bookmarked
4. Bookmark count on book card updates automatically

### Viewing Bookmarks
1. Click the list icon in PDF viewer controls
2. Bookmark sidebar slides in from the left
3. See all bookmarked pages for current book
4. Click arrow button next to any bookmark to jump to that page
5. Click X button to delete a bookmark

### Page Navigation
- **Arrow Buttons**: Click left/right arrows for previous/next page
- **Page Input**: Type page number and press Enter
- **Bookmarks**: Use bookmark sidebar for quick jumps

### Automatic Page Memory
- Close the PDF viewer at any time
- Your current page is automatically saved
- Next time you open the same book, it resumes from that page
- Each book remembers its own last page independently

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- localStorage required for bookmark/page persistence

## Storage Limits
- localStorage typically provides 5-10MB per domain
- Bookmark data is minimal (~100 bytes per bookmark)
- Supports thousands of bookmarks without issues

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- [ ] Add notes/annotations to bookmarks
- [ ] Export/import bookmark sets
- [ ] Highlight text within PDFs
- [ ] Search within PDFs
- [ ] Bookmark categories/tags
- [ ] Sync bookmarks across devices
- [ ] Reading progress statistics
- [ ] Dark mode for PDF viewer

## Benefits
1. **Productivity**: Quick access to frequently referenced pages
2. **Context Switching**: Each book remembers where you left off
3. **Organization**: Keep important pages bookmarked
4. **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive interface
5. **Performance**: Fast localStorage operations
6. **No Backend**: Works entirely client-side
