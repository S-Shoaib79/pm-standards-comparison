## 📋 Justification & Evidence

### Every Element is Standards-Based

**Example from Phase 1, Activity 1:**
```
Activity: "Define project vision and success criteria"
References:
- PMBOK 7 p.45: "Stewardship Principle: Focus on value delivery"
- PRINCE2 p.31: "Business Case: Investment appraisal and justification"  
- ISO 21502 p.17: "Benefits Management Practice: Identify and analyze benefits"
```

**Example Tailoring Decision:**
```
Decision: "Lightweight documentation"
Rationale: Small team and timeline need minimal overhead
Tradeoff: May require more knowledge transfer, but speeds delivery
References:
- PMBOK 7 p.193: "Tailoring for small projects"
- PRINCE2 p.48: "Tailoring documentation to project size"
```
