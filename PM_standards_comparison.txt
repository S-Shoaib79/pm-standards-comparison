-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) High-level approach / structure
- PMBOK 7: Principles-based standard (12 principles) + eight Project Performance Domains;
systems view and outcomes/value focus. Emphasizes tailoring and
models/methods/artifacts. (page number 45 for principles , 86 for Domains)
- PRINCE2: Method-based (integrated elements = Principles, Practices, Processes) with a
product-focused planning approach, explicit roles (Project Board, Executive, Senior
User/Supplier) and stage-based control. (Page 38 principles, page 68 practices, page
232)

- ISO (21500 /21502): ISO 21500 gives context/concepts; ISO 21502 provides guidance and
detailed management practices (clauses 7.x cover planning, risk, scope, quality,
procurement, etc.). ISO takes a high-level process/practice approach aligned to
organizational governance. (Page 35 for 21502)

Similarities (high level):
- All three require explicit governance, role clarity, planning, risk and change management,
stakeholder engagement, and alignment to organizational strategy.
fileciteturn1file6turn1file1turn1file5

Major difference (high level):
- PMBOK 7 is principles + performance-domain oriented (outcomes-focused); PRINCE2 is a
prescriptive method with defined practices/processes and named roles; ISO combines
context (21500) with practice guidance (21502) and is intentionally neutral/adoptable by
organizations. fileciteturn1file6turn1file13turn1file5

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Governance & Roles
- PMBOK 7: Describes organizational governance systems and functions associated with
projects; encourages tailoring of governance to context. (pg 36,40)
- PRINCE2: Strong governance model—explicit Project Board, project executive, clear
accountabilities, manage-by-exception (tolerances) and directing-process. (pg 93)
- ISO: Defines governance, governing body and project governance framework; aligns
project governance with organizational strategy and oversight. (pg 17 for 21502, pg 13
for 21500)

Similarities:
- Need for defined accountability, escalation routes, and oversight.
fileciteturn1file6turn1file13turn1file5

Differences / Unique:

- PRINCE2 prescribes named roles and the manage-by-exception mechanism (tolerances).
fileciteturn1file13
- PMBOK 7 is less prescriptive about specific job titles and more about functions and
behaviors (principles-driven). fileciteturn1file6
- ISO frames governance at organizational level (alignment with strategy and integrated
governance). fileciteturn1file5

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Tailoring & Adaptation
- PMBOK 7: Dedicated Tailoring section; tailoring driven by principles, organizational values
and project context; recommends PMIstandards+ for context-specific practices. (pg 193)
- PRINCE2: Explicit principle "Tailor to suit the project"; tailoring decisions captured in
initiation docs and approved by Project Board; practical guidance on what/how to tailor (pg
48, 66)

- ISO: Emphasizes selecting approaches based on organizational/contextual considerations;
ISO 21502 advises on how to adapt management practices to project context. (pg 26 for
21502)

Similarities:
- All require tailoring to project size, complexity, delivery method, risk, and organizational
environment. fileciteturn1file10turn1file1turn1file5

Differences:
- PRINCE2 expects formal tailoring decisions to be approved by governance (Project Board)
and captured in initiation documentation. fileciteturn1file14
- PMBOK focuses on tailoring guided by principles and provides a catalog of
models/methods (less prescriptive about approval steps). fileciteturn1file10
- ISO focuses on organizational selection criteria and alignment; less prescriptive about
specific approval gates (left to organizational practice). fileciteturn1file5

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Stakeholder Engagement
- PMBOK 7: Stakeholder Performance Domain — identification, analysis, engagement
strategies and continuous alignment. (pg 89,52, 87)
- PRINCE2: Emphasizes people and stakeholder groups; communications practice; roles
such as Senior User to represent stakeholders. (pg 43)
- ISO: Stakeholder management is a management practice (ISO 21502 clause 7.12) —
identify, engage and manage stakeholder expectations. (pg 47 book 21502)

Similarities:
- Systematic identification, ongoing engagement, and use of stakeholder analysis to inform
decisions. fileciteturn1file10turn1file13turn1file5

Differences:
- PRINCE2 assigns stakeholder representation into formal roles (Senior User/Supplier) and
links to project assurance; PMBOK treats stakeholder engagement as a cross-cutting
performance domain; ISO connects stakeholders to organizational governance and strategy.
fileciteturn1file13turn1file10turn1file5

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Risk Management
- PMBOK 7: Treats risk within the Uncertainty Performance Domain and promotes
optimizing risk responses; references broader PMI risk materials and a principles-based
approach. (pg 243)
- PRINCE2: Dedicated Risk practice—risk management approach, risk register, risk budget,
owners and action owners; explicit techniques and management products. (pg 168,
- ISO (21502): Risk management practice (7.8) — identify, assess, treat and control risks;
consistent with ISO risk terminology and processes. (pg 42 book 21502)
Similarities:
- All require identification, assessment (probability & impact), assignment of owners,
planned responses, monitoring and communication.
fileciteturn1file6turn1file9turn1file5

Differences / Unique:
- PRINCE2 explicitly uses "threats" and "opportunities" language and prescribes
management products like Risk Register and Risk Management Approach (with templates
and content guidance). fileciteturn1file9
- PMBOK 7 frames risk within a broader "uncertainty" domain and favors optimizing
responses across the performance system rather than fixed processes.
fileciteturn1file6
- ISO provides structured steps similar to PRINCE2 but positions them as guidance aligned
with ISO risk principles and often referenced to ISO 31000 practice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6) Planning (scope/schedule/cost)
- PMBOK 7: Planning Performance Domain — planning variables, communication,
procurement, changes, metrics and alignment; supports multiple delivery cadences and life
cycles. (pg 124)
- PRINCE2: Plans practice — product-based planning, relationship between
project/stage/team plans; stage boundaries and manage-by-stages. (pg 118)
- ISO: Includes planning practice (7.2) plus dedicated clauses for schedule (7.6) and cost
(7.7). (pg 30 21502)
Similarities:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7) Scope & Requirements / Product focus
- PMBOK 7: Focus on outcomes and deliverables inside performance domains; scope is
controlled within planning and project work. (pg 53)
- PRINCE2: Very product-focused (product descriptions drive scope, quality, acceptance).
Product Breakdown Structure and Product Flow Diagrams are core techniques. (26)
- ISO: Scope management as a discrete practice (7.4) — define, control, confirm scope
delivery. fileciteturn1file5 (pg 38 for 21502, pg 7 for 21500)

Similarities:
- All require formal definition, control and confirmation of scope/deliverables.
fileciteturn1file6turn1file3turn1file5

Differences:
